## Project Description

The objective of this project was to create a self-sufficient robot capable of executing pick-and-place operations. The robotic arm employed for manipulation is the Ur5, equipped with a zed camera for perception. The pick-and-place operation involves selecting various bricks and accurately positioning them in their predetermined locations. The robot possesses the capability to autonomously identify the bricks and execute the pick-and-place task.
